Yes, you read right. It's been long weekend. This game is developed in a game development event, Finnish Game Jam 2013.

The game is about a white blood cell defending its host agains worms. It is the Schwarzenegger of white blood cells. It can do it... whith your help.

Many thanks to Finnish Game Jam. This is the best event of the year!
